Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women worldwide. With early diagnosis, one can start timely clinical treatment and improve the chances of survival significantly. Diagnosis of Breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found in an x-ray or by self-examination. 

Mammography is an x-ray of the breast and is the most important screening test for the diagnosis. Women aged 40-45 years or older are usually at average risk of breast cancer and should have a mammogram once a year. Women with high risk should have yearly mammograms with MRI starting at age 30.

Most of the cases of breast cancer cannot be linked to a specific cause, but there are some of the known risk factors for the disease. 
The chance of getting breast cancer increases as women age. Women with breast cancer in one breast are at risk of developing cancer in the other breast too. A family history of breast cancer(if a woman's mother, sister or daughter has breast cancer) also raises the risk of getting it. Childbearing and menstrual history also affects the chances of getting breast cancer.
